Instalation
===========

COMPATIBILITY WARNING: Project Zomboid 2.9.9.17 (Steam version) and later

I've only tested on Mac, but it works surely on Linux/Windows.

Unzip ZSpawn-master.zip and drag the folder in Project Zomboid directory: <code>ProjectZomboid/Project Zomboid/Contents/Resources/Java/mods</code>

To activate the spawner in-game press Enter.
